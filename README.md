# DonInf2
Boiler plate code for the DonInf2 course. You can freely use this code to start your project.

## Fork (making a copy)
The best approach to get the code is to fork this repository. This will create your own copy of this repository. You need a github account in order to fork a repository.

- At the top left of the github window use the **Fork** button > **Create new fork**
- Make the repository private (optional)
    - Go to Settings
    - Collaborators and team
    - Manage visibility
    - Danger Zone > Change visibility > Make private
- Share the repository with your group members
    - Go to Settings
    - Collaborators and team
    - (Manage access) > Add people
- Once forked you can clone the repository locally on your maching using the command line or any other app.

## Running the project
Use your favorite IDE to run the project.

Alternatively, you can run the project with the `buildAndRun.sh` script. Open a terminal or console in the repository directory and run the following command

```
./buildAndRun.sh
```

To run the script, you need java installed on your computer.

If running a Windows computer you also need bash shell installed (for example Git For Windows https://gitforwindows.org/).
